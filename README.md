# js-state-machine
Demo of a Finite State Machine in JavaScript.

This is an experiment with state charts, as proposed by David Harel in 1987 while looking to create better ways of representing aircraft cockpit systems.

I wanted to try a vanilla JS example, despite the existence of the [XState library](https://xstate.js.org/). This was a deeply flawed attempt but interesting nevertheless.
